				<p>Hi there, I'm <strong>Clarice Ng</strong> (also commonly known as Clare), and I'm a 3rd year computer science student at the University of Waterloo.</p>
				<p>I'm a designer, doodler, and aspiring programmer. I was immersed in the computer science field fairly recently, but I'm enjoying all the fun and challenges it comes with.</p>

				<p>When I'm not in sitting in front of a computer, you might find me making art, playing video games, running on the badminton court, playing the flute, or tutoring other students. 
				<p>I speak in English, (un peu de) francais, and bad puns.</p>
