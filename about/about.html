			<h1>About</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>Hi there! I'm <strong>Clarice Ng</strong> (also commonly known as Clare), and I'm a 3rd year computer science student at the University of Waterloo.</p>
			
			<p>I'm a self-motivated and open-minded software developer and part-time illustrator. I was immersed in the computer science field fairly recently and I'm enjoying all the fun and challenges it comes with! My background and interests lie in human-computer interaction and full-stack web development, however I am also exploring in other dev areas too! You can check out my <a href="assets/resume.pdf"><strong>resume</strong></a> for more information.</p>

			<p>When I'm not in sitting in front of a computer, you can probably find me doodling in a sketchbook, playing video games, running on the badminton court, or eating good food.
