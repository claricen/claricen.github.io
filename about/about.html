			<h1>About</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>Hi there! I'm <strong>Clarice Ng</strong> (also commonly known as
				 Clare), and I'm a 4th year computer science student at the University
				 of Waterloo.</p>

			<p>I'm a self-motivated and open-minded software developer, designer,
				 and doodler. My background and interests lie in full-stack web
				 development and human-computer interaction, however I am also exploring
				 in other dev areas such as computer graphics and artificial
				 intelligence. You can check out my <a href="assets/resume.pdf"><strong>resume</strong></a>
				 for more information.</p>

			<p>When I'm not in sitting in front of a computer, you can probably
				 find me doodling, playing video games, running on the badminton court,
				 or eating good food.</p>
